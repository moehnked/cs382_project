# LISP
Introductory Research Proposal

## Why LISP?
	I have heard whispers of an ancient language since I began programming. This language is called LISP. The name is derived from “LIST Processor.” LISP was first invented in 1958 by John Mcarthy at MIT.  Lisp is a compiled general purpose language. One of the primary features of the language is that it offers Linked-List data structures. It allows source-code to be manipulated as a list structure. The language is implicitly typed. The fundamental structure of objects in a LISP program are called atoms and lists. A list is a finite sequence of elements which are either atoms or lists.
## How LISP?
	To learn more about what the language offers and how to use it to build applications, I will primarily be using youtube tutorials as my main source of information. In today’s age, there is a tutorial for just about anything on youtube. One could argue an equally, if not more, robust education can be attained through instructional youtube videos than can be acquired at a college or university, and for free. The wikipedia page for LISP (as well as any wikipedia page) has a section for references and further reading where the compiled information is derived. 
## What LISP?
	To demonstrate implementation of LISP, I will write a program that can generate several famous number sequences programmatically. The fibonacci sequence, Prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes , Lucas number sequence, and perhaps more. These are good functions to explore because many of these sequences can be generated using either iterative or recursive methods. Depending on the behavior of the sequence, some sequences are generated more or less efficiently using recursion, and LISP is a language which lends itself to recursive programming.
